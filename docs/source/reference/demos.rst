Demos
=====

A preponderance of Forge client library functionality is demonstrated in example Jupyter notebooks.

The quickest way to access the example Jupyter notebooks is to `register <https://app.forge.qcware.com/sign_up/>`_ as a Forge user and access the example notebooks through our hosted `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>`_ environment. Jupyter notebooks hosted on our service are pre-configured for Forge client library usage. **No additional setup required.**

Installation
------------

If you would like to install the example Jupyter notebooks locally, first, :ref:`install the Forge client library <LocalInstall>` and configure your local Jupyter environment to resolve Forge client library imports. This will allow you to run the example notebooks. Next, clone the `example notebook repository <https://github.com/qcware/forge_public_notebooks>`_, and explore its contents as desired.
