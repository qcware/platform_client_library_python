    r"""Outputs the distance between input vectors; quantum analogue of::
      numpy.linalg.norm(X - Y)**2

    Cases (following numpy.dot):
      x is 1d, y is 1d; performs vector - vector multiplication. Returns float.
      x is 2d, y is 1d; performs matrix - vector multiplication. Returns 1d array.
      x is 1d, y is 2d; performs vector - matrix multiplication. Returns 1d array.
      x is 2d, y is 2d; performs matrix - matrix multiplication. Returns 2d array.

    Arguments:

    :param x: 1d or 2d array
    :type x: Union[float, numpy.ndarray]

    :param y: 1d or 2d array
    :type y: Union[float, numpy.ndarray]

    :param circuit: Circuit to use for evaluation (None to implicitly create circuit), defaults to None
    :type circuit: quasar.Circuit

    :param loader_mode: , defaults to parallel
    :type loader_mode: str

    :param circuit_mode: , defaults to sequential
    :type circuit_mode: str

    :param backend: , defaults to qcware/cpu_simulator
    :type backend: str

    :param num_measurements: , defaults to None
    :type num_measurements: int


    :return: float, 1d array, or 2d array: distance estimation
    :rtype: Union[float, numpy.ndarray]"""
